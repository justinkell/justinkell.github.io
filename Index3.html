     			<p> A few months before last year ended I decided to created an online Ecom store and have been learning how to improve my sales every day. I have spent alot of time and money on material to teach me how I can improve. I have also learned alot from a really close freind of mine that also has his own Ecom buisness. I run my business from a platform called shopify and I drive trafic to my site with Facebook and also Instagram. I have learned alot in these past few months however there is always room for improvement. </p>
