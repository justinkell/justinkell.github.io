		<p> I am from Stoughton which is a small town in Massachusetts just 15 mins south of Boston. I went to Stoughton High School and played Football, Track and Field, and Lacrosse which was astablished by me and a small group of my friends. Our school was one of the only schools in the area that didnt have a Lacrosse program. Our small group had to raise $21,000 for our athletic director to buy all the equiptment and we were able to achive that in just a few months. In high school I worked at a small town hardware store and I also worked for a General Contractor doing home repairs, new construction, and also additions. </p>

		<p> I am currently enrolled in the business program at the University Of Maine. After high school I had no idea of what exactly I wanted to study however I thought I would like to be an engineer so for my first two semesters I was in the enginnering program. However I have always had the mentality of not having to work for someone else, I wanted to establish a business for myself after graduating from college. I want to be able to say I work for myself and be able to grow something of my own.</p>
